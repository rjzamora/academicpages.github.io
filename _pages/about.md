I am currenlty a computer scientist in the ALCF Data Science Group at Argonne National Laboratory. My research is focused on the developement and optimization of parallel algorithms for high-performance computing and (more recently) data science. Some topics of particular interest to me include:

- Parallel I/O Algorithms and Optimization (for Simulation and **Machine Learning**)
- Software Performance Prediction
- Accelerated Molecular Dynamics
- Software Sustainability and Productivity

Before joining Argonne, I was a postdoctoral researcher (and then staff scientist) in the Theoretical Division at Los Alamos National Laboratory. During my postdocdoral appointment in the *Physics and Chemistry of Materials Group*, I worked under the supervision of Arthur Voter, the pioneer of the accelerated molecular dynamics (AMD) approach to long-timescale simluations of interacting atoms. Through my wonderful experience at LANL, I had the opportunity to build a unique expertise in the developement of parallel simulation methodologies for high-fidelity materials simulation. 

Now, as an assistant computer scientist within the Argonne Leadership Computing Facility (ALCF), I have shifted most of my focus onto the developement of parallel I/O algorithms for extreme-scale computing. That is, I am leveraging my broad parallel-computing experience to help improve the efficiency of data access for both simulation software and machine learning. As a member of ALCF, I am also participating in the multi-institutional co-design of America's first *exascale* machine. Due to the explosive uptake of machine-learning in recent years, much of this effort will be focused on the optimization of data-centric software technologies.
