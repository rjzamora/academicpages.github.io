I am currenlty a computer scientist in the ALCF Data-Science Group at Argonne National Laboratory. Much of my past and present research has focused on the developement and optimization of parallel algorithms for high-performance computing and (more recently) data science. My recent/current projects are related to:

- Parallel I/O Algorithms and Optimization (for Simulation and **Machine Learning**)
- Software Performance Prediction
- Accelerated Molecular Dynamics
- Software Sustainability and Productivity

Before joining Argonne, I was a postdoctoral researcher (and then staff scientist) in the Theoretical Division at Los Alamos National Laboratory (in the Physics and Chemistry of Materials Group). During my postdoc, I worked under the supervision of Arthur Voter, the pioneer of accelerated molecular dynamics (AMD). Throughout my time at LANL, I had the opportunity to build a unique expertise in the developement of parallel simulation methodologies for high-fidelity materials simulation.

Now, as an assistant computer scientist within the Argonne Leadership Computing Facility (ALCF), I have shifted most of my focus onto the developement of parallel I/O algorithms for extreme-scale computing. That is, I am leveraging my broad parallel-computing experience to help improve data access for HPC simulation software and machine learning.
